**Project Description: Virtual Processor in Verilog**

This project involves designing a virtual processor using Verilog, aiming to simulate the basic architecture and functionality of a real CPU. The processor includes fundamental components such as registers, an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and a control unit.

A custom instruction set is implemented in machine code, supporting basic operations such as MOV, JMP, ADD, and others. The processor can decode and execute these instructions, simulating the execution cycle of real hardware.

The goal of this project is to understand low-level computer architecture by building a simplified but functional processor model capable of executing instructions step-by-step, just like a physical CPU.
